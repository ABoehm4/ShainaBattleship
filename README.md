# ShainaBattleship
So far I've created a method to assign difficulty and properly assign variables that hold missile value, 
char[][] boardgame values, and boardlength accordingly. 

Additionally I've created methods that set and get the above values so they can be used within objects of the
same class and instantiated in the main and action files. 

I have created a method to check the user's guess. I tested it and it works, but I am working on creating a 
method to obtain user input right now so you won't see that.

I have created a method to output the gameboard with ~ in each space.

I have created an array list that will hold the ships.

No ship positioning yet.
